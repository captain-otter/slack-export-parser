# slack-export-parser

## How to use
First you need to export your slack data. Instruction on how to do that: https://slack.com/help/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data
Once you have the zip file and have extracted the content then:

1. Download the executable from releases and run it. (easier option)
2. Alternatively you can download .NET version of Godot 4.3 and open/run the project through that. (more complicated option)
3. Once you have the program open, click the green "Locate channels.json file"-button
4. Locate and open the channels.json file. Program will immediately start parsing the files.
5. New "export" folder will be generated in the same folder as the channels.json file and all files will be dumped there.
